By convention, variables or methods starting with a single underscore (_) are considered \"internal\" and should not be accessed directly from outside the class. However, Python does not enforce strict access control like some other programming languages. There are no true private variables in Python, as everything is ultimately accessible. However, the use of the single underscore is a common convention to indicate that a variable or method is intended for internal use and should be treated as such."
