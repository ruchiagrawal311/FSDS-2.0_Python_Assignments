    "- Assignment Expressions (the \"walrus operator\") - Allows assignment within an expression using the := operator.\n",

    "Monkey patching in Python refers to the practice of dynamically modifying or extending the behavior of existing classes or modules at runtime. It allows you to add, replace, or modify attributes, methods, or functions of existing objects without changing their original source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monkey patching can be useful in situations where you want to customize the behavior of a class or module without having to modify its original code. It provides flexibility to adapt or enhance existing functionality to suit specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, monkey patching should be used with caution as it can make code more complex and harder to understand, especially in larger projects. It's important to ensure that monkey patches are well-documented and applied judiciously to avoid unexpected side effects or conflicts with other parts of the codebase."
