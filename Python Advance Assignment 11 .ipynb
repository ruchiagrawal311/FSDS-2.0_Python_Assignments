Class decorators are functions applied directly to the class definition, while metaclasses define the behavior of classes. They overlap in their ability to modify classes, but metaclasses offer more control over the class creation process. Anything you can do with a class decorator, you can of course do with a custom metaclasses (just apply the functionality of the \"decorator function\", i.e., the one that takes a class object and modifies it, in the course of the metaclass's __new__ or __init__ that make the class object!)."
